1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Automating the tests is easier than having to manually run tests every time, and also more consistent and can help catch problems earlier on in the develpment process. If tests are only run manually, one could forget or not test frequently enough. And running tests all after development is completed is even worse, since if all problems are caught at the end, there likely will be many more issues that would take much longer to fix all at once.
2) No, unit tests would be more appropriate.
